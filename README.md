This repository contains Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) [[Raissi 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045) , [Cuomo 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-022-01939-z)] that describe the formation of relativistic electrons (Runaway Electrons, RE). Specifically, two PINNs are presently available, describing a primary generation mechanism known as "hot-tail formation" [[McDevitt 2023](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0164712)], and secondary generation known as the "runaway electron avalanche" [[Arnaud 2024](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.04948)]. Both PINNs solve a PDE that describes the probability of an electron running away $P$ as a function of energy, parallel direction of momentum $\xi \equiv p_\Vert/p$, and relevant physics parameters.
