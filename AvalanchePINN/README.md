This directory contains a physics informed neural network (PINN) that predicts the parametric dependence of the exponential "avalanche" growth rate of relativistic electrons (runaway electrons, RE) $\gamma_{av}$, on the plasma's parallel electric field strength $E_\Vert$, effective charge $Z_{eff}$, and synchrotron radiation strength $\alpha$. Further details on the formulation of the PINN is found in the [paper]([https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.04948](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022377824000679)). To launch the script that trains the PINN, simply run the command **DDEBACKEND=tensorflow.compat.v1 RPF_paper.py**, assuming the environment created in the parent directory of this repo is activated, and the **DDEBACKEND** must be **tensorflow.compat.v1**. If the correct libraries and modules are not loaded, the script will typically either throw an error or run inefficiently (i.e the GPU will not be utilized).
